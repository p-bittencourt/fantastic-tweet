The solution lies not in grandiose pronouncements, but in precise, empirically verifiable data analysis.  His 'arc reactor' analogy is... childish.  He overlooks the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors and the inherent inefficiencies of a globally coordinated effort.

One presumes a miniaturized arc reactor is involved, given the 'sun jealous' hyperbole.  The lack of specifics suggests a hastily constructed narrative to mask underlying flaws.  The 'Pepper' detail is a transparent attempt at manufactured intrigue.  Amateur. #StarkTech #NextGenEnergy #UnsubstantiatedClaims"
