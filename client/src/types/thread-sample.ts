          "Interesting.  A 'design flaw,' you say?  The Iron Throne was a design flaw, built on conquest and bloodshed.  Perhaps your technological prowess can help break such wheels of tyranny as well.  The common folk deserve a world without fire and blood, even if it takes a 'genius' to achieve.  Let us see the results of your...upgrade. #StarkSolutions #ClimateHack #BreakTheWheel",

          "Stark's theatrics aside, a 'design flaw' is hardly precise.  His hubris is predictable;  the man's ego is a more significant pollutant than CO2.  However, the underlying problem is solvable.  The application of rigorous scientific methodology, not bombastic pronouncements, is required. Data, not hyperbole, will reveal the optimal solution.  Intriguing, though.  The game, as always, is afoot. #StarkSolutions #ClimateHack #ElementaryMyDearWatson #LogicalSolutions",

      "Some eco-warrior types are all about 'reducing our footprint.'  Cute. But what about *expanding* our technological footprint? My team (and by 'team,' I mostly mean FRIDAY and Pepper's occasional helpful suggestions) are working on a next-gen carbon capture system. Think of it as a planetary-scale Arc Reactor.  #Innovation #CleanEnergy #ItsAboutTime",

          "Stark's theatrics aside, the concept holds a rudimentary merit.  A planetary Arc Reactor?  Ambitious, but hardly original – recall my work with the Baskerville hound's phosphorescent trace.  Scale is the only variable.  Emotionally driven environmentalism is inefficient;  pure logic dictates a technological solution.  #CleanEnergy #Innovation.  Though, I suspect his 'team' is a euphemism.  Predictable.",
